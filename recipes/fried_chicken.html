        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This is a simple recipe on how to make fried chicken in the most efficient timing
            and not having to prepare an outrageous amount of ingredients. 
        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 Chicken</li>
            <li>3 Eggs</li>
            <li>2 cup Flour</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp Salt</li>
            <li>2 tsp Garlic Powder</li>
            <li>2 tsp Pepper</li>
            <li>1 tsp Paprika</li>
            <li>Vegetable Oil</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                In a large bowl, beat the eggs. In another bowl, 
                combine the salt, pepper, garlic powder and paprika to make a seasoned salt. Add the flour to a third bowl.
            </li>
            <li>Prepare the chicken by first seasoning each piece of chicken to your taste 
                with the seasoned salt. Then dip each piece in the egg and drag through flour until coated well.
            </li>
            <li>
                Fill a large pot or deep fryer half full with oil and heat to 350°F. 
                Place the chicken parts in and fry until dark and crisp. The thighs and 
                legs will take longer to cook – about 15 minutes – than the breast and 
                wings, which will take about 10 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove from heat, let sit for 5 minutes to cool and enjoy!
            </li>
        </ol>
